# Retail Billing System and EDA on Retail Data

This project is a retail billing system created using Python and Tkinter. The application allows you to generate and manage bills, save data to an Excel file, and perform exploratory data analysis on the sales data. Additionally, the system provides features to search bills by bill number, email the bill to the customer, and print the bill.

## Features

- **Billing System**: Create and manage retail bills.
- **Data Storage**: Save billing data to an Excel file (`retail_dataset.csv`).
- **Search Bills**: Search for bills using the bill number.
- **Email Bills**: Send the bill to the customer's email.
- **Print Bills**: Print the bill for the customer.
- **Data Analysis**: Perform exploratory data analysis on the sales data using Jupyter Notebook (`Analysis_sales.ipynb`).

## Files

- `demoapp_excel.py`: The main application script for the retail billing system.
- `retail_dataset.csv`: The dataset containing billing information.
- `Analysis_sales.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis of the sales data.
